                                   Weird Name?

GenaDrive is a porn-star emulator, based on legendary porn star Jenna Ja... no not really.
GenaDrive (one word, capital G, capital D), is pronounced "Jen-A-Drive".

(Think 'MegaDrive' but with 'Gen' instead of 'Meg'.)

                               Okay but what is it?

  GenaDrive is a partially-complete MegaDrive emulator for the XBox. It emulates the
  hardware of the MegaDrive console on the XBox. Basically, it makes your XBox act like
  a MegaDrive.

  It actually uses the same code-base as my Pocket PC 'PicoDrive' emulator, but instead
  of an ARM-optimized 68000 emulator it uses (naturally) an Intel-optimized one - A68K
  from the MAME project.

                                   How to use

  Put the emulator (default.xbe) in a directory such as e:\Emulators\GenaDrive\
  Make sure there is a directory e:\Emulators\GenaDrive\Roms
  Put your rom images there.

  Run GenaDrive.
  If it doesn't work, try running 'xbepatch' on the XBE first to convert it to a retail XBE.

  This is minimal zip support, though there must be no other files in each zip.

  Run the emulator and you will see a list of rom images. Push up/down and press A
  to select a rom image.
  Click the Right thumbstick in to pause and return to the menu.

  To exit the emulator hold L and R and press Black, or press Back+Start.

  This is just an early version so there's quite a few things missing or not up to scratch,
  e.g. sound, z80, joypad 2

Web page and contact info:

  I (Dave) can be reached at the usual spot, my web-page is:

  And my e-mail address is as follows, just change the (atsymbol) to @
  
    dev(atsymbol)finalburn.com

  NB - I had to shut down the 'dave' mailbox so it's now 'dev', because the 'dave'
  e-mail address was printed everywhere and spambots logged it and spammed it to death! :P
  So if you must quote it, please quote it as above... or better yet just link to my webpage.

Thanks to:
  Mike Coates and Darren Olafson once again for A68K
